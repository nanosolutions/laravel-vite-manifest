## Overview

The Laravel Vite Manifest package adds a Blade directive to include Vite's JS and CSS output files, pulled from the generated manifest file. The main logic of this package was sourced from https://github.com/andrefelipe/vite-php-setup.

## Usage

```
composer require nanosolutions/laravel-vite-manifest
```

Add the `@vite` directive where you want to include the JS and CSS files:

```
// app.blade.php

@vite
```

By default, the directive will attempt to include the `js/app.js` file. However, if you have a different entrypoint file, you can pass that into the directive:

```
// app.blade.php

@vite(js/main.js)
```

It is recommended you include your source `.css` files from within your source `js/app.js` file. This will allow Vite to include it as a dependency.
